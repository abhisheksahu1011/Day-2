    <h1>What is React? What are its features</h1>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Reacted was created by jordane walke
                a softwarwe engineer  at facebook in year 2011 and </li>
            <li>it was deployed first at facebook newsfeed  and later was used in facebook and instagram</li>
            <li>React is a  open source front end library </li>
            <li>It follows component base approach for building reusalble user interface components espically for single face application and it is use for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile application</li>

            <h1>Features:-</h1>
            <li>Virtual DOM</li>
            <li>One Way Data binding</li>
            <li>Resulable components</li>
            <li>JSX (javascript synte Extension)</li>
            <li>Performance</li>
        </ol> 
    


    <h1>What is Virtual DOM??</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time.
        
        <li> whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM.</li>
            
            So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. </li>
            <li>Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values.</li>
        <li>Dom stands for Document object Model And it represent the state and logical structure of Document.whenever our js is loaded in browser</li>
        <li> Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm.</li>
        <li> Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>What is library and FrameWork</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Library is set of reusable function ised by computer programs</li>
        <li>Framework is a piece of code thats dectates the architecture of project  </li>
        <li>Code will call in library but in frameWork call the code</li>
        <li>In library we can control the data flow by methods </li>
        <li>but in framework we dont have any control of the code.</li>
        <li>n library we can control the flow taht is nothing but frameWork call the code</li>
        <li>In profermance wise react is having high performance and veu and comminity supoort </li>
        <li>React is hhaving the easy learning curve and react is having SPA(Single page application)</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>What is the diff between class and functional components? why we are moving towards functional comp ?</h1>

    <ol>
        <h2>Class component</h2>
        <li>Class component usse the lifecycle method </li>
        <li>Class component are also called stateful component</li>
        <li>There is no render  </li>
        <li>In class component props and state can be accepted</li>
        <li>It is hard to read and complex strecture</li>
        <li>In class component We use "this" keyWord </li>
    </ol>
             
    <ol>
        <h2>Functional Component</h2>
        <li>Functionsl component we use Hoocks </li>
        <li>Functional component are also called state less component</li>
        <li>In function there is return</li>
        <li>Functional Component is a plan javascript it doesn't have choice</li>
        <li>Functional component only accepts props as an argument </li>
        <li>It is easy to read</li>
        <li>We dont need Keywods</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>State ful and state less</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>If it is using state it is stateful component </li>
        <li>it can hold and can manage the state</li>
        <li>It is complex as compare to stateless component</li>
        <li>It can work with lifecycle it can use any usestate HOOKS</li>
        <li>It can be reuse</li>
        <li>It is class component</li>

        <h2>StateLess</h2>
        
        <li>If not using state it is state less component</li>
        <li>It doesn't hold any manage state</li>
        <li>it is simple and easy to understand</li>
        <li>Propes Is done </li>
        <li>It does not work with any reaact lifecycle</li>
        <li>It cannot be reuse</li>
        <li>It is also known as functional component</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Initial phase</li>
        <li>Mounting</li>
        <li>Unmounting</li>
        <li>Updating Phase</li>
    </ol>


    <h1>What is Single Page Application or SPA? Explain the difference between SPA and MPA</h1>

    <ol>
      
        <li>MPA which is having slow speed and performance is affected by reloading</li>
       
        <li>Code from Scrach no option for reusabality</li>
        
        <li>Maintain is must for each page difficult to maintain</li>
        <li>According to SEO SPA id having limited optimization</li>
        
        <li>MPA bad user experience</li>
        <li>According to security Spa secure end to end </li>
       



        <h2>SPA</h2>
        <li>In term of speed and performance SPA n reloading is needed that is equal to high speed and responsivenedd</li>
        <li>According coding wise reusable code for single page application </li>
        <li>Maaintainece SPA is having fast and easy to maintain</li>
        <li>According to SEO SPA id having several optimization</li>
        <li>thre is no loding time required for SPA</li>
        <li>According to security Spa secure only endpoint </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Differentiate between states and props.</h1>
    <li>Propes are read only </li>
    <li>It can be axis by child component</li>
    <li>It is uses to communicate between Components</li>
    <li>Propes are Inmutable </li>
    <li>It is extranal and control by whatevetr render the component </li>



    <h2>State</h2>
    <li>State changes can be asynchronous</li>
    <li>State cannot  be axis by child component</li>
    <li>It can be use for rendering dynamic changes within the component </li>
    <li>state are mutable </li>
    <li>It is internal and control by react component Itself </li>


    <h1>Explain props drilling concept and state uplifting</h1>

    <h1>with use context</h1>

    


<h2>props drilling</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Props dreallig is basically a situation in the same data is been sent to sent it almost every due to requirement is the final level </li>
    <li>when we have to share the same data across multiple child components then define the data into the paraent
    </li>
    <li>Every Component i react has its own state because of these sometimes data can be reambaundent and in consxinsent so by liftinf up the state  of the parent component as the single source of truth and pass the data of the children in its parent   </li>
</ol>
<h2>state uplifting</h2>
<ol>
    <li></li>
</ol>

<h1>What do you know about controlled and uncontrolled components?</h1>
<h2>controlled components</h2>

<ol>
    <li>It aloows valadation control</li>
    <li>the react componet  data is control by parent component also</li>
    <li>It has better control over the forms and data</li>
</ol>
<h2>uncontrolled components</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In it data is control by DOM itself </li>
<li>It not allow valadation control</li>
<li>It has limitd control over the forms and data</li>
</ol>

<h1>What is React Router?</h1>
<ol>
    <li>React route is standered library routing in react in enables the navagation amont the views of a various component in react application it allows changing the browser URL</li>
    <li>React router place a important role to display multiple  views in a single page application </li>
</ol>
